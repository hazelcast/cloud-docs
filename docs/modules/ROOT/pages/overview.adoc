== Development Workflow

{hazelcast-cloud} runs as the server in a client/server topology.

You can run Java code in {hazelcast-cloud} to process batch or streaming data as well as cache your custom objects in distributed data structures, or ingest data from databases.

The Java code that you run in {hazelcast-cloud} is called a _cluster-side module_. You develop and test these modules before deploying them to a {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

After deploying a cluster-side module, you can use clients to interact with the cluster. For example, you can use a client to connect to the cluster's SQL shell and query your data.

== Use Cases

These are just a few examples of use cases for {hazelcast-cloud}.

=== Caching Layer for your Applications

You can use {hazelcast-cloud} as a low-latency, high-performance caching or data layer for your applications.
