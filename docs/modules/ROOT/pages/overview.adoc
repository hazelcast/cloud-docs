Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} eliminates the manual effort of managing physical servers or servers in the cloud so that you can focus on what matters: building your application.

== Application Topology

{hazelcast-cloud} applications run in a client/server topology:

- {hazelcast-cloud} clusters are the servers that are responsible for storing and processing your data.

- Clients connect to your cluster to submit new processing jobs, request processing results, add data to storage, or query data.

== Editions

Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} offers the choice of two editions:

|Edition|Description

|{hazelcast-cloud} Standard
|{hazelcast-cloud} Standard clusters auto-scale, depending on the amount of data you store. 

|{hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated
|To maximize security whilst minimizing latency, {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated clusters expose only private Hazelcast endpoints. For consistent performance and throughput, {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated clusters do not share infrastructure with any other customers.
