:page-aliases: cpp-client.adoc, getting-started.adoc, go-client.adoc, net-client.adoc, nodejs-client.adoc, python-client.adoc, sql.adoc

{description}

== Before you Begin

You need the following:

- A xref:create-account.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} account].
- Access to a command prompt such as Terminal for Mac or Powershell for Windows.

== Step 1. Start a Development Serverless Cluster

include::serverless-cluster.adoc[tag=development]
To create a development cluster, do the following:

include::create-serverless-cluster.adoc[tag=development] 

== Step 2. Run a Sample Client

To connect to your Serverless cluster, you need a Hazelcast client. {hazelcast-cloud} comes with sample clients that are preconfigured to connect to your cluster and add some sample data to a map.

TIP: A map is an in-memory, key/value data structure that is often used as a cache.

Choose a client and follow the instructions.

SQL (CLI):: 
+ 
--
. Install the Hazelcast CLI client. Use one of the following methods, depending on your operating system.
+
.Mac
[source,bash]
----
brew tap hazelcast/hz
brew install hazelcast-enterprise
----
+
.Linux Debian
[source,shell]
----
wget -qO - https://repository.hazelcast.com/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://repository.hazelcast.com/debian stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install hazelcast-enterprise
----
+
.Linux RPM
[source,shell]
----
wget https://repository.hazelcast.com/rpm/hazelcast-rpm.repo -O hazelcast-rpm.repo
sudo mv hazelcast-rpm.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo yum install hazelcast-enterprise
----
+
.Windows
At the moment, Hazelcast does not support any Windows package managers. The easiest way to use the CLI on Windows is to install the Hazelcast Enterprise Docker image. The Docker container comes with the `hz-cli` client. See xref:hazelcast:getting-started:install-enterprise.adoc[].

. Check that the CLI client is installed.
+
[source,shell]
----
hz-cli -V
----
+
You should see your installed version of the CLI client.

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console].

. Click *Connect Client*.

. Go to the *SQL* tab and download the ZIP file.

. Extract the ZIP file.
+
This file contains the credentials that allow the CLI to connect to your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

. Change into the directory where you extracted the ZIP file.

. Connect to the SQL shell on your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.
+
```bash
hz-cli -f hazelcast-client-with-ssl.yml sql
```
+
You should see the SQL prompt:
+
```
sql>
```

. Create a mapping to a new map called `cities`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING cities (
__key VARCHAR, 
country VARCHAR, 
city VARCHAR,
population INT)
type IMap OPTIONS('keyFormat'='varchar', 'valueFormat'='json-flat');
----

. Add some data to the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO cities VALUES
(1, 'United Kingdom','London', 9_540_576),
(2, 'United Kingdom','Manchester', 2_770_434),
(3, 'United States', 'New York', 19_223_191),
(4, 'United States', 'Los Angeles', 3_985_520),
(5, 'Turkey', 'Ankara', 5_309_690),
(6, 'Turkey', 'Istanbul', 15_636_243),
(7, 'Brazil', 'Sao Paulo', 22_429_800),
(8, 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', 13_634_274);

[[step-3]]
== Step 3. Query the Cache with SQL

Now that you have some data in your cluster, you can query it, using SQL. If you're using the CLI, enter the following  queries in the SQL prompt. If you're using a client library, enter the following queries in the SQL Browser.

. Use the `SELECT` statement to query all data in the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM cities;
----
+
```
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
|       __key|country             |city                |population    |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
|           2|United Kingdom      |Manchester          |2770434       |
|           6|Turkey              |Ankara              |5309690       |
|           1|United Kingdom      |London              |9540576       |
|           7|Brazil              |Sao Paulo           |22429800      |
|           8|Brazil              |Rio de Janeiro      |13634274      |
|           5|Turkey              |Istanbul            |15636243      |
|           4|United States       |Los Angeles         |3985520       |
|           3|United States       |New York            |19223191      |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
```
+
The results are in a random order because the data is distributed across the {hazelcast-cloud} cluster. Whenever a cluster member has the result, it returns it to the client.

. Order the results by the key.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM cities ORDER BY __key;
----
+
Now you see the results start from key 1 and end with key 8.

. Query only the countries by filtering on the `countries` column.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM cities;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|country             |
+--------------------+
|United Kingdom      |
|Turkey              |
|United Kingdom      |
|Brazil              |
|Brazil              |
|Turkey              |
|United States       |
|United States       |
+--------------------+
```

. Query only the cities by filtering on the `cities` column.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city FROM cities;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|city                |
+--------------------+
|Manchester          |
|Ankara              |
|London              |
|Sao Paulo           |
|Rio de Janeiro      |
|Istanbul            |
|Los Angeles         |
|New York            |
+--------------------+
```

. Change the output to display cities first in alphabetical order.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city, country
FROM cities
ORDER BY city;
----
+
```
+--------------------+--------------------+
|city                |country             |
+--------------------+--------------------+
|Ankara              |Turkey              |
|Istanbul            |Turkey              |
|London              |United Kingdom      |
|Los Angeles         |United States       |
|Manchester          |United Kingdom      |
|New York            |United States       |
|Rio de Janeiro      |Brazil              |
|Sao Paulo           |Brazil              |
+--------------------+--------------------+

```

. Use a filter to display only countries where the name of the city is at least 11 characters long.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM cities WHERE LENGTH(city) >= 11;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|country             |
+--------------------+
|Brazil              |
|United States       |
+--------------------+
```

. Use another filter to display only cities beginning with the letter 'L' where the length is greater than 6.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city
FROM cities
WHERE city LIKE 'L%' AND LENGTH(city) > 6;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|City                |
+--------------------+
|Los Angeles         |
+--------------------+
```
