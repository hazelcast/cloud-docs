== Before you Begin

You need the following:

- A xref:create-account.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} account].
- Access to a command prompt, such as Terminal for Mac or Powershell for Windows.

== Step 1. Start a Cluster on {hazelcast-cloud} Standard or Trial

If you already have a cluster.

. Sign in to the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank]

. Check that your cluster is running. If it is paused, you'll see the following at the top of the dashboard.
+

[[step-2]]
== Step 2. Connect a Sample Client

To connect to your {hazelcast-cloud} Standard or Trial cluster, you need a Hazelcast client. The cluster comes with sample clients that are preconfigured to connect to your cluster and add some sample data to a map. A map is an in-memory, key/value data structure that is often used as a cache.

Choose a client and follow the instructions.

--
If you've followed the onscreen *Quick Connection Guide* in the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank], jump straight to <<step-5clc, step 6>>.

. xref:clc:ROOT:install-clc.adoc[Install the Hazelcast CLC client] for your operating system.

. Run the following command to check that the Hazelcast CLC client is installed.
+
[source,shell]
----
clc version
----
+
If installed, the installed version of the Hazelcast CLC client displays.

. In the *Quick Connection Guide*, go to step 2 and run the `clc config import` command to import the configuration of your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

. Now execute the following command to connect the Hazelcast CLC to your cluster. Replace the placeholder `$CLUSTER_ID`. You can find the cluster ID on the dashboard of your cluster under *Cluster Details*.
+
```bash
clc -c pr-$CLUSTER_ID
```
+
A CLC prompt is displayed:
+
```
pr-$CLUSTER_ID>
```
+
The Hazelcast CLC client is successfully connected to your cluster.

. [[step-5clc]]Quit the Hazelcast CLC before you continue.

+
```
\exit
```
. [[step-x]]Create a mapping to a new map called `cities`.
+
[source,bash]
----
clc sql -c pr-$CLUSTER_ID "CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING cities (
__key INT,
country VARCHAR,
city VARCHAR,
population INT)
type IMap OPTIONS('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat'='json-flat');"
----

. Add some data to the map.
+
[source,bash]
----
clc sql -c pr-$CLUSTER_ID "INSERT INTO cities VALUES
(1, 'United Kingdom','London', 9540576),
(2, 'United Kingdom','Manchester', 2770434),
(3, 'United States', 'New York', 19223191),
(4, 'United States', 'Los Angeles', 3985520),
(5, 'Turkey', 'Ankara', 5309690),
(6, 'Turkey', 'Istanbul', 15636243),
(7, 'Brazil', 'Sao Paulo', 22429800),
(8, 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', 13634274);"
----
. Continue to the <<step-3, next step>> to query your sample data using SQL queries with CLC.
--
====

[[step-3]]
== Step 3. Query the Cache Using CLC

Now that you have some data in your cluster, you can query it using CLC. In the following instructions, we use interactive mode to run SQL queries directly.

NOTE: Ensure that there is a semi-colon (;) at the end of each SQL query. If this is omitted, CLC assumes that you are entering a multi-line query.

If CLC is not connected, enter the following command replacing the `$CLUSTER_ID` placeholder with your cluster ID:

```bash
clc -c pr-$CLUSTER_ID
```

A CLC prompt is displayed:

```
pr-$CLUSTER_ID>
```

NOTE: You can find the cluster ID on the dashboard of your cluster under *Cluster Details*.

In the following steps, you enter SQL queries at the CLC prompt to display data in your cluster.

. Run the following `SELECT` statement to query all data in the map:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM cities;
----
+
```
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
|       __key|country             |city                |population    |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
|           2|United Kingdom      |Manchester          |2770434       |
|           6|Turkey              |Ankara              |5309690       |
|           1|United Kingdom      |London              |9540576       |
|           7|Brazil              |Sao Paulo           |22429800      |
|           8|Brazil              |Rio de Janeiro      |13634274      |
|           5|Turkey              |Istanbul            |15636243      |
|           4|United States       |Los Angeles         |3985520       |
|           3|United States       |New York            |19223191      |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
```
+
The results are in a random order because the data is distributed across the cluster. Whenever a cluster member has the result, it returns it to the client.

. Run the following `SELECT` statement to order the results by the key:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM cities ORDER BY __key;
----
+
Now, you see the results ordered from key 1 to key 8.

. Run the following `SELECT` statement to query only the countries using a filter on the `countries` column:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM cities;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|country             |
+--------------------+
|United Kingdom      |
|Turkey              |
|United Kingdom      |
|Brazil              |
|Brazil              |
|Turkey              |
|United States       |
|United States       |
+--------------------+
```

. Run the following `SELECT` statement to query only the cities using a filter on the `cities` column:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city FROM cities;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|city                |
+--------------------+
|Manchester          |
|Ankara              |
|London              |
|Sao Paulo           |
|Rio de Janeiro      |
|Istanbul            |
|Los Angeles         |
|New York            |
+--------------------+
```

. Run the following `SELECT` statement to display cities in alphabetical order at the start of the output:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city, country
FROM cities
ORDER BY city;
----
+
```
+--------------------+--------------------+
|city                |country             |
+--------------------+--------------------+
|Ankara              |Turkey              |
|Istanbul            |Turkey              |
|London              |United Kingdom      |
|Los Angeles         |United States       |
|Manchester          |United Kingdom      |
|New York            |United States       |
|Rio de Janeiro      |Brazil              |
|Sao Paulo           |Brazil              |
+--------------------+--------------------+

```

. Run the following `SELECT` statement to apply a filter that displays only countries where the name of the city is at least 11 characters long:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM cities WHERE LENGTH(city) >= 11;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|country             |
+--------------------+
|Brazil              |
|United States       |
+--------------------+
```

. Run the following `SELECT` statement to apply a filter that displays only cities that begin with the letter 'L' and have a length greater than 6:
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city
FROM cities
WHERE city LIKE 'L%' AND LENGTH(city) > 6;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|City                |
+--------------------+
|Los Angeles         |
+--------------------+
```
