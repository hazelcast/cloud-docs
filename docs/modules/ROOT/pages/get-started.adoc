== Before you Begin

You need the following:

- A xref:create-account.adoc[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} account].
- Access to a command prompt such as Terminal for Mac or Powershell for Windows.

== Step 1. Start a {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless Cluster

If you already have a {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless cluster.

. Sign in to the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank]

. Check that your cluster is running. If it is paused, you'll see the following at the top of the dashboard.
+
image:ROOT:paused-cluster.png[This]

. If you need to restart the cluster, in the *Cluster Details* panel, click *Resume*.

. Click *Connect Client* and go to <<step-2, step 2>>.

To create a new development cluster.

include::create-serverless-cluster.adoc[tag=development] 

[[step-2]]
== Step 2. Connect a Sample Client

To connect to your {hazelcast-cloud} Serverless cluster, you need a Hazelcast client. The cluster comes with sample clients that are preconfigured to connect to your cluster and add some sample data to a map. A map is an in-memory, key/value data structure that is often used as a cache.

Choose a client and follow the instructions.

[tabs] 
====
Java:: 
+ 
--
Before you begin:

* Install Java 8-17 and set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location of your JRE.
* If you've followed the onscreen *Quick Connection Guide*, jump straight to <<step-6, step 5>>.

[]
. In the *Quick Connection Guide* on your cluster, click on the Java icon and then click *Download*.

. Extract the ZIP file.

. From a command prompt, change into the root directory of the extracted files.

. Execute one of the following commands to run your client:

.. If you use Linux or Mac, execute: 
+ 
```bash
./mvnw clean compile exec:java@client-with-ssl
```
.. If you use Windows, execute: 
+
```bash
mvnw.cmd clean compile exec:java@client-with-ssl
```
+
When you see `Connection Successful!` in the output, the client is successfully connected to your Serverless cluster and populates a `cities` map with data.

. To query data in the `cities` map:

.. [[step-6]]In *Cluster Details*, click *Management Center*, and then from the top toolbar click *SQL Browser*.

.. Continue to the <<step-3, next step>> to query your sample data in the SQL browser.

TIP: Take a moment, to read the code in the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cloud-java-sample-client/blob/5.1/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/cloud/ClientWithSsl.java[`ClientWithSSL.java`] file to understand how the client connected. 
--

Python:: 
+ 
--
Before you begin:

* link:https://www.python.org/downloads/[Install Python 3.6 or newer].
* If you've followed the onscreen *Quick Connection Guide*, jump straight to <<step-6py, step 5>>.

[]
. In the *Quick Connection Guide*, click on the Python icon and then click *Download*.

. Extract the ZIP file.

. From a command prompt, change into the root directory of the extracted files.

. Execute the following command to run your client:
+
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt && python client_with_ssl.py
```
+
When you see `Connection Successful!` in the output, the client is successfully connected to your Serverless cluster and populates a `cities` map with data.

. To query data in the `cities` map:

.. In step 3 of the *Quick Connection Guide* on your cluster, click *Dashboard*.

.. [[step-6py]]In *Cluster Details*, click *Management Center*, and then from the top toolbar click *SQL Browser*.

.. Continue to the <<step-3, next step>> to query your sample data in the SQL browser.

TIP: Take a moment, to read the code in the link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cloud-python-sample-client/blob/5.1/client_with_ssl.py[`client_with_ssl.py`] file to understand how the client connected.

SQL (CLI):: 
+ 
--
If you've followed the onscreen *Quick Connection Guide*, jump straight to <<step-7, step 7>>.

[]
. Install the Hazelcast CLI client for your operating system.
+
.Mac
[source,bash]
----
brew tap hazelcast/hz
brew install hazelcast-enterprise
----
+
.Linux Debian
[source,shell]
----
wget -qO - https://repository.hazelcast.com/api/gpg/key/public | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://repository.hazelcast.com/debian stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install hazelcast-enterprise
----
+
.Linux RPM
[source,shell]
----
wget https://repository.hazelcast.com/rpm/hazelcast-rpm.repo -O hazelcast-rpm.repo
sudo mv hazelcast-rpm.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo yum install hazelcast-enterprise
----
+
.Windows
At the moment, Hazelcast does not support any Windows package managers. The easiest way to use the CLI on Windows is to install the Hazelcast Enterprise Docker image. The Docker container comes with the `hz-cli` client. See xref:hazelcast:getting-started:install-enterprise.adoc[].

. Check that the CLI client is installed.
+
[source,shell]
----
hz-cli -V
----
+
You should see your installed version of the CLI client.

. In the *Quick Connection Guide*, click the SQL icon and then click *Download*.

. Extract the ZIP file which contains credentials that allow the Hazelcast CLI to connect to your cluster.

. From a command prompt, change into the root directory where you extracted the ZIP file.

. Execute the following command to connect the SQL shell to your cluster. You may need add a path to the hz-cli program.
+
```bash
hz-cli -f hazelcast-client-with-ssl.yml sql
```
+
A SQL prompt is displayed:
+
```
sql>
```
+
The Hazelcast CLI client is successfully connected to your Serverless cluster.

. [[step-7]]Create a mapping to a new map called `cities`.
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING cities (
__key INT,
country VARCHAR,
city VARCHAR,
population INT)
type IMap OPTIONS('keyFormat'='int', 'valueFormat'='json-flat');
----

. Add some data to the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO cities VALUES
(1, 'United Kingdom','London', 9540576),
(2, 'United Kingdom','Manchester', 2770434),
(3, 'United States', 'New York', 19223191),
(4, 'United States', 'Los Angeles', 3985520),
(5, 'Turkey', 'Ankara', 5309690),
(6, 'Turkey', 'Istanbul', 15636243),
(7, 'Brazil', 'Sao Paulo', 22429800),
(8, 'Brazil', 'Rio de Janeiro', 13634274);
----
. Continue to the <<step-3, next step>> to query your sample data in the SQL browser.
--
====

[[step-3]]
== Step 3. Query the Cache with SQL

Now that you have some data in your cluster, you can query it, using SQL. If you're using the CLI, enter the following  queries in the SQL prompt. If you're using a client library, enter the following queries in the SQL browser.

. Execute the following `SELECT` statement to query all data in the map.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM cities;
----
+
```
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
|       __key|country             |city                |population    |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
|           2|United Kingdom      |Manchester          |2770434       |
|           6|Turkey              |Ankara              |5309690       |
|           1|United Kingdom      |London              |9540576       |
|           7|Brazil              |Sao Paulo           |22429800      |
|           8|Brazil              |Rio de Janeiro      |13634274      |
|           5|Turkey              |Istanbul            |15636243      |
|           4|United States       |Los Angeles         |3985520       |
|           3|United States       |New York            |19223191      |
+------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------+
```
+
The results are in a random order because the data is distributed across the cluster. Whenever a cluster member has the result, it returns it to the client.

. Order the results by the key.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM cities ORDER BY __key;
----
+
Now you see the results start from key 1 and end with key 8.

. Query only the countries by filtering on the `countries` column.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM cities;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|country             |
+--------------------+
|United Kingdom      |
|Turkey              |
|United Kingdom      |
|Brazil              |
|Brazil              |
|Turkey              |
|United States       |
|United States       |
+--------------------+
```

. Query only the cities by filtering on the `cities` column.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city FROM cities;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|city                |
+--------------------+
|Manchester          |
|Ankara              |
|London              |
|Sao Paulo           |
|Rio de Janeiro      |
|Istanbul            |
|Los Angeles         |
|New York            |
+--------------------+
```

. Change the output to display cities first in alphabetical order.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city, country
FROM cities
ORDER BY city;
----
+
```
+--------------------+--------------------+
|city                |country             |
+--------------------+--------------------+
|Ankara              |Turkey              |
|Istanbul            |Turkey              |
|London              |United Kingdom      |
|Los Angeles         |United States       |
|Manchester          |United Kingdom      |
|New York            |United States       |
|Rio de Janeiro      |Brazil              |
|Sao Paulo           |Brazil              |
+--------------------+--------------------+

```

. Use a filter to display only countries where the name of the city is at least 11 characters long.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT country FROM cities WHERE LENGTH(city) >= 11;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|country             |
+--------------------+
|Brazil              |
|United States       |
+--------------------+
```

. Use another filter to display only cities beginning with the letter 'L' where the length is greater than 6.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT city
FROM cities
WHERE city LIKE 'L%' AND LENGTH(city) > 6;
----
+
```
+--------------------+
|City                |
+--------------------+
|Los Angeles         |
+--------------------+
```
