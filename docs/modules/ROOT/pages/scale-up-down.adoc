= Scaling a Dedicated Cluster
:description: Scaling clusters is useful when you need to increase available memory to handle higher than normal workloads. You can also control monthly costs by reducing memory when you expect lower loads.

{description}

Dedicated clusters scale horizontally, which means that you can adjust the resources available to your application, such as memory, by adding members (scaling out) or removing members (scaling in). Each Dedicated cluster is a network of at least three instances or _members_, with a fixed set of resources allocated to each one.

To scale a team's cluster, you must have either an xref:teams-and-users.adoc[admin or developer role].

== Before you Begin

Calculate how much memory your cluster needs before scaling out or in. If your data structures have backups, include those in your calculations. For example, if a map has a backup count of 1 (default) and the size of its entries equal 5 MB, then the map's total data size is 10 MB (primary entries + backup entries).

Scaling a cluster may take up to 8 or 10 minutes.

== Scaling Out

When data in a cluster occupies 80% of all available memory, we send a warning email to the account or team owner. At this point, we recommend scaling out the cluster, which adds more members and therefore more resources such as memory. When you scale out a cluster, client applications do not experience any downtime. However, the cluster may temporarily experience lower throughput while members migrate their partitions.

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} Console] and select your cluster.
. Go to *Manage* > *Settings* > *Scale Up/Down*.
+
- *Instance Count Per Zone*: Number of members you have in each availability zone. 
- *Total Instance Count*: Total number of members you have for all availability zones.
- *Number Of Zones*: Number of zones used in the cluster.

. Select a new count of instances for each availability zone. You can select an instance count between 1 and 10. As you select the count, the *Total Instance Count Will Be* field will show you the new count of total instances in your cluster.

== Scaling In

If you're using fewer resources than you thought you would when you created the cluster, you can scale in the cluster.

WARNING: If you scale in to a size that's smaller than your actual data size, some of your data will be removed.

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console] and select your cluster.
. Go to *Manage* > *Settings* > *Scale Up/Down*.
+
- *Instance Count Per Zone*: Number of members you have in each availability zone.
