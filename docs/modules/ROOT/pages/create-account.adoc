== Keeping your Account Safe

After you set up your account, you’ll want to keep it safe. Here are some recommendations:

- *Keep private information secure:* Keep your password and any xref:developer.adoc[API keys] private.

- *Use teams to provide others with access to your account:* Don't give anyone access to your account. To allow others to work with your clusters, you can xref:teams-and-users.adoc[invite others to a team] so they can log in and take certain actions, but with limited access.

- *Enable multi-factor authentication:* Protect your account from anyone who may know your username and password. With xref:multi-factor-authentication.adoc[multi-factor authentication], you'll need to provide a unique code that's generated on your device as well as your username and password to sign in.

- *Allow only authorized devices to access your cluster:* If you use Hazelcast Serverless, you can xref:ip-white-list.adoc[set up an IP whitelist] to allow only known IP addresses to access your cluster. If you use Hazelcast Dedicated, the cluster is private by default. You'll need to xref:vpc-peering.adoc[set up a VPC connection] to connect to the cluster.
