= Synchronizing Clusters
:description: To synchronize data between two or more Enterprise clusters, you can use WAN replication.

{description}

WAN Replication is a tool that can do *Active-Active* and *Active-Passive* replication. You can also configure WAN Replication parameters according to your use-case.

For a complete reference of this feature, see xref:hazelcast:wan:wan.adoc[].

== Terminology

[cols="e,a"]
|===
|Term|Definition

|Publisher Cluster
|The cluster that sends data within WAN Replication

|Consumer Cluster
|The cluster that receives data from publisher within WAN Replication
|===

== Prerequisites

You need at least two active clusters on the link:{page-plans}[Enterprise plan]. To learn how to create an Enterprise cluster, see xref:create-enterprise-cluster.adoc[].

[WARNING]
====
If clusters are hosted on the *same* cloud provider, you can create WAN Replication between *public <-> public*, *public <-> private*, and *private <-> private* clusters.

If clusters are hosted on *different* cloud providers, you can create WAN Replication only between *public <-> public* clusters.

== Creating WAN Replication

In order to create WAN Replication, you can go to *Cluster Detail* > *Settings* > *Wan Replication* and click *Create New Replication*

You will see current cluster as Active cluster and also you can see additional parameters:

- *Queue Full Behavior:* WAN Replication uses Hazelcast Queue within its architecture to manage data replication events. This parameter  lets you to decide what to do next if this queue is full. 
- *Queue Capacity:* Capacity of queue and if queue us full, the criteria in first item will be applied.
- *Batch Size:* You can define the size of batch operation for data replication with this param
- *Batch Max Delay Millis:* Even data replication events is not reached to batch size amount, data will be replicated to consumer cluster when you reach this delay limit.

After setting all this parameters, you can click *Next* to select and configure consumer cluster.

Settings on this screen for consumer cluster are same as publisher cluster except *Active/Passive* section. If you set consumer cluster as *Active*, data will be synchronized from/to publisher and consumer. If you set consumer cluster as *Passive*, data will be sent only from publisher to consumer. 
Once you configured settings for consumer, you can click *Save*

Within seconds, wan replication will be ready there.

Once it is finished, you can verify it by going to management center *Cluster Detail* > *Management Center* > *Enable*  then *Management Center* > *Open Management Center*.

When you connect publish cluster and try to write some data, you will see data will be replicated to consumer cluster
