To create a cluster for a team, you must have either an xref:create-account.adoc#roles[admin or developer role].

== Before you Begin

You need a xref:create-account.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} account].

To create more than one cluster, you must add a xref:payment-card.adoc[payment card] to your account.

== Using the {hazelcast-cloud} Console

Development::

To create a development cluster, do the following:

// tag::development[]
. Sign into the [.console]*link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console]*.
. Click *Plans* in the left navigation.
. Click *Create cluster* in the *Serverless* tab.
. Click *Create Development Cluster*.
. Select a region.
+
NOTE: For best performance, use a region that's closest to your client application or data stores. The closer your clients and data are to the cluster, the lower the network latency.

. Give your cluster a memorable name. You cannot change your cluster name after it has been created.

It takes a few minutes to create a Serverless cluster. When the cluster state changes from *Pending* to *Running*, you can start using it.
// end::development[]

Production::

To create a production cluster, do the following:

// tag::production[]
. Sign into the [.console]*link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console]*.
. Click *Plans* in the left navigation.
. Click *Create cluster* in the *Serverless* tab.
. Click *Create Production Cluster*
. Select a region.

== Next Steps

Development and production clusters are stopped when both of these conditions are true:

- You don't connect to the cluster for 24 hours.
- You don't have a payment method set up for your {hazelcast-cloud} account.
