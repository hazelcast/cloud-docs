= Creating a Serverless Cluster
:description: You can create a free xref:serverless-cluster.adoc[Serverless cluster] for development or production.
:page-aliases: create-starter-cluster.adoc, starter-clusters.adoc, create-standard-cluster.adoc, availability-zones.adoc, instance-types.adoc
:page-serverless: true

{description}

== Before you Begin

You need a xref:create-account.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} account].

To create more than one cluster, you must add a xref:payment-methods.adoc[payment card] to your account.

== Using the {hazelcast-cloud} Console

[tabs] 
====
Development cluster:: 
+ 
--
To create a development cluster, do the following:

// tag::development[]
. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console].
. Click *Plans* in the left navigation.
. Click *Create cluster* in the *Serverless* tab.
. Click *Create Development Cluster*.
. Select a region.
+
TIP: For best performance, use a region that's closest to your client application or data stores. The closer your clients and data are to the cluster, the lower the network latency.

. Give your cluster a memorable name. You cannot change your cluster name after it has been created.

It takes a few minutes to create a Serverless cluster. When the cluster state changes from *Pending* to *Running*, you can start using it.
// end::development[]

Production cluster::

--
To create a production cluster, do the following:

// tag::production[]
. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console].
. Click *Plans* in the left navigation.
. Click *Create cluster* in the *Serverless* tab.
. Click *Create Production Cluster*
. Select a region.

NOTE: For best performance, use a region that's closest to your client applications or data stores. The closer your clients and data are to the cluster, the lower the network latency.
. Give your cluster a memorable name. You cannot change your cluster name after it has been created.

// end::production[]

[NOTE]
====
Development and production clusters are stopped when both of these conditions are true:

- You don't connect to the cluster for 24 hours.
- You don't have a payment method set up for your {hazelcast-cloud} account.
