= Working with Cluster-Side Modules in Hazelcast Cloud
:description: Cluster-side modules are Java classes that a Hazelcast Cloud cluster can execute or store in the cloud. You can write cluster-side modules to execute custom code or store custom objects. This guide describes the workflows and best practices for implementing cluster-side modules for Hazelcast Cloud.

{description}

The basic workflow for any cluster-side module is the following:

. *Build* the Java class and implement any required interfaces.
. *Test* your implementation on a Serverless development cluster.
. *Deploy* your Java classes to your Hazelcast Cloud cluster.

Then you can use any client to interact with the cluster-side modules such as querying objects or triggering processes.

== What are Cluster-Side Modules

Cluster-side modules include any code that must be deployed as Java code to the cluster, including the following:

|===
|Module|Description

|link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/MapStore.html[MapStore]
|Ingest data from an external data source into a Hazelcast map, or add data from a Hazelcast map to an external data source.

|link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/map/EntryProcessor.html[Entry processor]
|Atomically execute code on a map entry.

You cannot use a custom name for entry processors in Hazelcast Cloud. You must use the one called `default`.

|link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/IExecutorService.html[Executor]
|Asynchronously execute tasks, such as database queries, complex calculations, and image rendering.

You cannot use a custom name for executors in Hazelcast Cloud. You must use the one called `default`.

|Custom object class (domain objects)
|Allow Hazelcast Cloud to store or process domain objects that you use in your applications.

|Process streaming or batch data in Hazelcast Cloud, using one or more data sources and sinks.

[[serializers]]
== Supported Serializers

Cluster-side modules need to be sent to other members in the cluster or one of your client applications. As a result, these modules need to be serialized.

Hazelcast Cloud supports the following serializers. Follow the links to learn more about these serializers in the Hazelcast Platform documentation.

| Serializer| Advantages| Disadvantages|Client support

| xref:hazelcast:serialization:compact-serialization.adoc[Compact Serialization] [.beta]*Beta*
|

* Convenient, flexible, and can be used with no configuration

* Does not require a class to implement an interface

* Supports schema evolution

* Partial deserialization is supported during queries and indexing

|* Specific to Hazelcast

* Schema is not part of the data but schema distribution
may incur costs on short-lived use cases

* The format is in a beta state and no compatibility
guarantees are given yet

|All clients

| xref:hazelcast:serialization:serializing-json.adoc[Hazelcast JSON]
| * No member-side coding required

|* Specific to Hazelcast

* Requires extra metadata to be stored on members.

|All clients

| xref:hazelcast:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc[Serializable]
| * A standard and basic Java interface

* Requires no implementation
| * More time and CPU usage

* More space occupancy

|Java only

| xref:hazelcast:serialization:implementing-java-serializable.adoc[Externalizable]
| * A standard Java interface

* More CPU and memory efficient than Serializable
| * Serialization interface must be implemented

[[prereqs]]
== Requirements and Limitations

Any Java code in cluster-side modules must meet the following requirements.

=== Java Version

Hazelcast Cloud supports only Java version 11 or earlier. Do not use a Java version greater than version 11.

=== System-Level APIs

No code in cluster-side modules is allowed to access system-level APIs. Hazelcast throws a Java Security Exception if any cluster-side modules try to access these APIs.

=== Package Names

Your package names should not start with `com.hazelcast`. Hazelcast ignores these packages.

=== Package Size

Hazelcast Cloud allows you to upload packaged files up to 500 MB. Larger files are rejected.

=== Dependency Conflicts

The libraries in your project must not conflict with those that are built into Hazelcast Cloud. If your project includes a library thatâ€™s already available in Hazelcast Cloud, you may experience conflicts that stop Hazelcast from processing your cluster-side modules. To avoid packaging conflicting libraries in your code, we recommend using one of the following options:

- *Shaded JARs:* When you shade JARs, the classes inside them are relocated and rewritten to create a private copy of them that is bundled alongside your code. To learn more about shaded JARs, see this link:https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/297276/what-is-a-shaded-java-dependency[answer on Stack Overflow].
- *Provided scope:* When you use the provided scope for a JAR, it is available in your classpath during compilation but will not be packaged with your project archive. To learn more about provided scope, see the docs for your build tool:

** link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Scope[Maven]
** link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/migrating_from_maven.html#migmvn:declaring_deps[Gradle]

== Testing Cluster-Side Modules
[.serverless]*Serverless*

Before you go into production with your cluster-side modules, it's best to test them to make sure that they work as expected. To test cluster-side modules, follow these best practices:

- *Use a development cluster:* It's faster to test cluster-side modules in a xref:serverless-cluster.adoc[development cluster]. These clusters include only a single member. Single-member clusters are faster because you don't need to wait for the cluster to replicate your cluster-side modules over other members or create and update backup replicas of your data.
- *Use the Maven plugin:* The xref:maven-plugin.adoc[Maven plugin] allows you to package and deploy your cluster-side modules in a single command from your IDE.

[[deploy]]
== Moving to Production

After testing your cluster-side modules, you need to deploy them to production.

For production, you can deploy your cluster-side modules either to a xref:create-serverless-cluster.adoc[Serverless production cluster] or a xref:create-dedicated-cluster.adoc[Dedicated cluster].

NOTE: You need to provide payment details to run more than one Hazelcast Cloud cluster.
