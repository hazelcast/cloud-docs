= Management Center

Hazelcast Management Center enables you to monitor and manage your cluster members running Hazelcast. In addition to monitoring the overall state of your clusters, you can also analyze and browse your data structures in detail, update map configurations and take thread dumps from the members. You can run scripts (JavaScript, Groovy, etc.) and commands on your members with its scripting and console modules. See the xref:management-center:ROOT:index.adoc[official docs] to learn more.

Hazelcast Cloud Enterprise provides a metrics view-only access to the Management Center of your Hazelcast cluster so that you can get more useful insights about a cluster state, data structure metrics and other important aspects.
