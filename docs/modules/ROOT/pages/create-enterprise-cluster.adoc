:description: Enterprise clusters are ideal for large applications that need dedicated instances of a virtual private cloud (VPC).

NOTE: When you create an Enterprise cluster, you are charged not only the hourly rate, but also for data transfer costs as well as storage costs (if you turn on backups). See xref:pricing.adoc[].

== Before you Begin

To create a cluster for a team, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Create the Cluster

. Click *Plans & Pricing* in the header.

. In the Enterprise plan, click *Create Cluster*.

. Select one of the available Cloud providers on which to host your cluster:
+
** AWS
** Microsoft Azure
** Google Cloud Platform

. Select a region.
+
NOTE: For best performance, choose a region that's closest to your client applications. The closer your clients are to the cluster, the lower the network latency.

. Select an instance type that offers the resources that you plan on using.
+
You cannot change this selection after the cluster is created.
+
For details about the cost of instances, see xref:pricing.adoc[].

. Choose whether to host your instances in a single availability zone or in a multi-zone environment (three zones within a region), and select the number of instances that you want in each zone.
+
Hosting a cluster in a multi-zone environment prevents data loss after a zone failure. To make sure that all data is available after a single zone failure, Hazelcast, backups are stored in different availability zones, using the xref:hazelcast:clusters:partition-group-configuration.adoc[ZONE_AWARE partition grouping] feature of Hazelcast.

. To encrypt communications between clients and your cluster, turn on TLS Encryption.
+
You cannot change this selection after the cluster is created.

. If you want all clients to be able to connect to your cluster, turn on Public Access.
+
We recommend leaving this disabled.

. If you want to persist cluster data on disk and have that data backed up in cloud storage, turn on Backup/Snapshot.
+
You cannot change this selection after the cluster is created.
+
If you turn on this feature, you will be charged for the extra storage costs. See xref:pricing.adoc[].
+
WARNING: Persisting data can degrade throughput by up to 40%. For details about persistence, see xref:hazelcast:storage:persistence.adoc[].

. If you store custom objects in Hazelcast and you want to query or process them, click *Edit* in the Custom Classes field and add those classes to your cluster.
+
TIP: You can also add custom classes after the cluster is created.

. If you need more or fewer available IP addresses in your VPC instance, edit the VPC CIDR range.
+
You cannot change this selection after the cluster is created.
+
For an introduction to VPC CIDR, see xref:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing[Classless Inter-Domain Routing].

. If you want to use an older version of Hazelcast, select a new version from the Hazelcast Version field.
+
After the cluster is created, you will only be able to upgrade the version.

. To configure data structures before starting your cluster, click *Data Structures Configuration*.
+
TIP: You can also add data structure configuration after the cluster is created.

. Enter a name for your cluster and click *CREATE CLUSTER*.

It takes between 30-50 minutes to create an Enterprise cluster. During this period, your cluster will be in a pending state. When the cluster state changes to running, you will be able to use it.
