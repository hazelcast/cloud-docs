There are 2 ways of creating a GCP VPC Peering connection:

- Use the CLI (recommended)
- Create a manual connection

To create a peering connection on a team cluster, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Using the {hazelcast-cloud} CLI

This option provides the easiest way of creating GCP VPC Peering with your Dedicated cluster.
 
=== Set Up Your Environment

. Install link:{page-url-github-cloud-cli}[{hazelcast-cloud} CLI].

. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your Google Cloud credentials file. 
+
You can check further details about these credentials in the link:{url-google-cloud-authentication}[Google Cloud documentation].

=== Creating a Peering Connection

. Create the peering connection.
+
[source,shell]
----
hzcloud gcp-peering create \
--cluster-id=<YOUR CLUSTER ID> \
--project-id=<YOUR PROJECT ID> \
--network-name=<YOUR VPC NETWORK NAME>
----
+
Make sure to replace the following placeholders:
+
- `YOUR CLUSTER ID` with the ID of your cluster.
+
To get your cluster ID, use the `hzcloud enterprise-cluster list` command of the {hazelcast-cloud} CLI.
- `YOUR PROJECT ID` with the ID of your project which contains your network on Google Cloud.
+
For details about Google Cloud projects, see the link:{url-google-cloud-projects}[Google Cloud documentation].
- `YOUR_VPC_NETWORK_NAME` with the Name of your VPC network on Google Cloud 
on your terminal.
+
For details about Google Cloud VPC Networks, see the link:{url-google-cloud-vpc}[Google Cloud documentation].

. Check for active peerings from the VPC Network Peering tab after you select your VPC on Google Cloud Platform for your side of peering.

WARNING: Do not overlap the CIDR of your Dedicated cluster and the CIDR of your VPC, otherwise the connection will fail.

== Creating a Manual Connection

You can still create VPC peering without using {hazelcast-cloud} CLI. But, you need to handle everything it does properly. This way is more difficult but more configurable.

In order to create VPC Peering, you need to do the following:

. Collect GCP Peering Properties for your Cluster with our API. 
. Create a GCP Peering connection from your side to our side.
. Accept our side of the GCP Peering connection you already sent with API.

=== Collecting Properties

To create your side of the VPC Peering connection, you need to collect GCP Peering properties for your cluster. 
You can get these properties from the link:{page-url-cloud-api}[GraphQL API] or the link:{page-url-github-go-sdk}[Go SDK]

[tabs] 
====
GraphQL API:: 
+ 
--
[source,javascript]
----
query {
  gcpPeeringProperties(clusterId: "{YOUR_CLUSTER_ID}") {
    projectId
    networkName
  }
}
----
--
Go SDK:: 
+ 
--
[source,go]
----
client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
properties, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.GetProperties(context.Background(), &models.GetGcpPeeringPropertiesInput{
  ClusterId: "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID",
},
)
fmt.Println(properties.ProjectId)
fmt.Println(properties.NetworkName)
----

==== 

=== Creating a Peering Connection

After you successfully collect peering properties, you need to create a peering connection from your VPC to the Hazelcast VPC, using values you collected from peering the properties.

TIP: Learn how to create a VPC Peering connection on Google Cloud in the link:{url-google-cloud-vpc-peering}[Google Cloud documentation].

=== Accepting a Peering Connection

After you successfully create a VPC Peering to the Dedicated cluster, you need to accept that connection, using the GraphQL API or the Go SDK:

[tabs] 
====
GraphQL API:: 
+ 
--
[source,javascript]
----
mutation {
  acceptGcpPeering(input: {
    clusterId: "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID", 
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    networkName: "YOUR_NETWORK_NAME" }){
    status
  }
}
----
--
Go SDK:: 
+ 
--
[source,go]
----
client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
result, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.Accept(context.Background(), &models.AcceptGcpPeeringInput{
  ClusterId:   "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID",
  ProjectId:   "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  NetworkName: "YOUR_NETWORK_NAME",
},
)
fmt.Println(result.Status)
----
--
==== 

=== Validating Peering Connections

After you see the status value as `Accepted`, you can check active peerings from the *Peerings* tab after you select your VPC on Google Cloud Platform for your side of peering. 

WARNING: The CIDR of your Dedicated cluster and the CIDR of your VPC must not overlap. Otherwise you will not see peering in this list.

== Listing Peering Connections

You can list Google Cloud Platform peerings for your cluster on GCP from the {hazelcast-cloud} console by going to *Cluster Details > Settings > VPC Peerings* one by one.

You can check where the connection is established by checking Project ID and Network Name on the list.

Also, you can use the Go SDK, {hazelcast-cloud} CLI for this.

====
{hazelcast-cloud} CLI::

[source,shell]
----
hzcloud gcp-peering list --cluster-id={YOUR_CLUSTER_ID}
----

Go SDK::

[source,go]

client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
peerings, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.List(context.Background(), &models.ListGcpPeeringsInput{
  ClusterId:   "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID",
},
)
for _,peer := range *peerings {
  fmt.Println(peer.Id)
  fmt.Println(peer.NetworkName)
  fmt.Println(peer.ProjectId)
}
----

== Deleting Peering Connections

You can delete Google Cloud Platform peerings from your Dedicated cluster in the {hazelcast-cloud} console as well as the Go SDK and the {hazelcast-cloud} CLI.

[tabs] 
====
{hazelcast-cloud} CLI:: 
+ 
--
[source,shell]
----
hzcloud gcp-peering delete --peeering-id={ID_OF_PEERING}
----

Go SDK::

[source,go]
----
client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
result, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.Delete(context.Background(), &models.DeleteGcpPeeringInput{
  Id: "ID_OF_PEERING",
},
)
fmt.Println(result)
