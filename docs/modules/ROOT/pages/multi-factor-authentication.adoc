== Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication

. Install an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator on your device.
. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank].
. Go to *Account* > *Security*.
. Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code that is displayed in the Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console. 
. Enter the six digit verification code into the input box in the Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console and click *Enable MFA*.
. Sign out and try signing in again.

After entering your username and password, you will be asked to enter the verification code, using the authenticator app.

Verification codes are specific to a particular device and cannot be transferred. If you switch to a new phone, you will need to <<disable, disable MFA>> before you do so, then re-enable it with your new phone.
