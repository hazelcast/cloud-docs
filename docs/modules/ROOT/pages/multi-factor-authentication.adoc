. Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code that is displayed in {hazelcast-cloud}. 
. Enter the 6 digit verification code into the input box in {hazelcast-cloud} and click *Enable two factor authentication*.
. Sign out and try signing in again.

After entering your username and password, you will be asked to enter the verification code, using the authenticator app.
