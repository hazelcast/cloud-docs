= Dedicated Clusters
:description: {hazelcast-cloud} Dedicated gives you fine-grained control over the hardware and resources available to your cluster. Dedicated clusters also offer strict container isolation for projects that require enhanced data security.

== Pricing for Dedicated Clusters

Dedicated clusters are charged for the following:

- *Provisioned memory:* How many resources you asked for when we created the cluster for you.
- *Data transfer:* The volume of data going into, out of, and within your clusters.
- *Cluster data storage:* If you requested persistence for your data, this is the cost of storing your cluster data in cloud storage.

=== Provisioned Memory

Hazelcast charges you a fixed amount, depending on how much memory capacity is reserved for your cluster. If your cluster has 10 GB capacity but you do not use all that memory, you are still charged for the full 10 GB because this amount of memory was reserved for your use.

These examples show the cost per month of three clusters that each have a different memory capacity and uptime:

[cols="a,a,a,a"]
|===
|Cluster|Memory|Total uptime per month|Cost

|1
|10 GB
|10 hours
|10 X 10 X $0.10 = $10.00

|2
|1 GB
|100 hours
|1 X 100 X $0.10 = $10.00

|3
|3 GB
|50 hours
|3 X 50 X $0.10 = $15.00

|===

In this scenario, the total cost for the month for all three clusters will be: $10.00 + $10.00 + $15.00 = $35.00

Dedicated clusters also incur charges for data transfer costs and any backup storage costs.

=== Data Transfer

Data transfer costs account for the volume of data going into, out of, and within your clusters.

Your data transfer charges are aggregated over the month and added to your monthly bill.

=== Cluster Data Storage

If persistence is enabled on your cluster, Hazelcast stores your cluster data in cloud storage, which comes with additional costs.

The cost of cluster data storage depend on the cloud providers cost of storing the data in their object store such as S3 on AWS.
