= Migrating an Embedded Application to {hazelcast-cloud}
:description: To migrate an existing application from embedded Hazelcast to {hazelcast-cloud}, you need to <<refactor, refactor your code>> as well as consider how you <<migrate, migrate any existing data to the cloud>>.

{description}

TIP: For the benefits of migrating your application from an embedded topology to a client/server topology such as {hazelcast-cloud}, see this link:https://hazelcast.com/blog/from-embedded-to-client-server/[blog].

== Refactoring Code for the Cloud

Applications in {hazelcast-cloud} are split into two parts:

- The cluster-side that runs on {hazelcast-cloud}.

- The client-side that calls APIs on {hazelcast-cloud}.

To separate your embedded application into these two parts, see the following checklist:

- [ ] Deploy xref:cluster-side-modules.adoc[cluster-side modules] to {hazelcast-cloud}. If you use classes such as MapStore or an entry processor, or if you store custom objects in Hazelcast, you need to add those classes to the classpath of {hazelcast-cloud} by deploying them as cluster-side modules.
- [ ] Copy any data structure configuration over to {hazelcast-cloud}. Data structures are configured in the {hazelcast-cloud} console.
- [ ] Remove member configuration from your code. Hazelcast configures the cluster for the best possible performance. All you need to do is configure the client and any data structures.
- [ ] If you use the executor service, make sure that you are using the ‘default’ service in both uploaded executor services and client code. You cannot access named executor services in {hazelcast-cloud}. 
- [ ] Replace any instance of
`HazelcastInstance
newHazelcastInstance` with a client. `newHazelcastInstance` creates an instance of a Hazelcast member. Instead, you need to configure a client to xref:connect-to-cluster.adoc[connect to the cluster].

== Migrating Stateful Data

If you have existing data stored in Hazelcast, consider one of the following ways to migrate that data to {hazelcast-cloud}:

- Use xref:wan-replication.adoc[WAN Replication].
+
NOTE: To use WAN Replication, your need the Hazelcast Enterprise JAR. 
- Reingest data, using one of the available xref:hazelcast:ingest:overview.adoc[APIs/tools].
