= Authorizing Client Connections
:description: You can restrict access to your cluster to allow only authorized clients to connect to it.

{description}

== Serverless

If you're using a Serverless cluster, you can add your client IP addresses to a xref:ip-white-list.adoc[whitelist].

== Dedicated

If you're using a Dedicated cluster, you must authorize your clients to connect to your cluster. Dedicated clusters are private by default to prevent attacks such as denial of service. To authorize clients, you can do the following:

- Add client IP addresses to a xref:ip-white-list.adoc[whitelist].
- Set up xref:vpc-peering.adoc[PrivateLink or VPC peering].

TIP: You should use PrivateLink or VPC peering if your clients' IP addresses are not static or if you want to limit your cluster's exposure to the public Internet.
