:description: This tutorial shows you how to get started with Hazelcast Cloud quickly. You'll create a Hazelcast Serverless cluster, and then use the Python client to add some entries to a map.

{description}

== Before you Begin

You need a xref:create-account.adoc[Hazelcast Cloud account].

== Step 1. Start a Hazelcast Cloud Cluster

In the Hazelcast Cloud console, do the following:

include::create-serverless-cluster.adoc[tag=development] 

== Step 2. Run the Sample Client

. Open the Hazelcast Cloud console and click *Connect your Application*.

. Go to the *Python* tab and download the ZIP file.

. Extract the ZIP file, change into the extracted root directory and execute the following command:
+
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && python client_with_ssl.py
```

You should see log output similar to the following:

image:python-client-log.png[Python client logs that it is connected]

`Connection Successful!` in your logs means that your client application has successfully connected to your cluster in Hazelcast Cloud. The sample client code adds random entries to a map in your cluster. In your Hazelcast Cloud console, you should see the charts begin to be populated with metrics of your map.

Also, you can see your client listed under *Client Statistics* at the bottom of your cluster's page.

== Client Code

To help you understand how the client connected to the cluster, this section explains some of the source code. 

TIP: The code for this sample client is hosted on link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-cloud-python-sample-client/tree/5.1/client_with_ssl.py[GitHub].

        my_map.put("key" + random_key, "value" + random_key)
        my_map.get("key" + random_key)
        iteration_counter += 1
        if iteration_counter == 10:
            iteration_counter = 0
            print("Map size:", my_map.size())

HazelcastCloudDiscovery._CLOUD_URL_BASE = "YOUR_DISCOVERY_URL"

client = hazelcast.HazelcastClient(
    cluster_name="YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME", <2>

    ssl_certfile=abspath("cert.pem"),
    ssl_keyfile=abspath("key.pem"),
    ssl_password="YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD",
)

print("Successfully connected!")

sample_map = client.get_map("map").blocking()

# the 'map_example' is an example with an infinite loop inside, so if you'd like to try other examples,
# don't forget to comment out the following line
map_example(sample_map)
----

<1> Add random entries with 100-millisecond intervals.

<2> Set the cluster name.
+
The cluster name is unique to your cluster. The client is authenticated using this cluster name.

<3> Set the discovery token.
+
This token is also unique to your cluster and used to discover Hazelcast cluster members.

<4> Enable Hazelcast to send the client statistics to the cluster's page.

<5> Configure TLS encryption. You already downloaded these certificate and key files with the client code.
