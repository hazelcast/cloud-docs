To stop clusters in a team, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Stopping a Cluster

Stopping your cluster can help minimize your costs during development because you are only charged for running clusters.

. Sign into the [.console]*link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console]* and select your cluster.
. Go to *Manage Cluster* and click *Stop*.

If you're using a Serverless production cluster or a Dedicated cluster, {hazelcast-cloud} saves your cluster data so that you can resume the cluster at a later time.
