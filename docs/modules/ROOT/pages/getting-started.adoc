:description: It's free to create an account on Hazelcast Cloud and get started with a free cluster.

{description}

To set up a free cluster, you need to do the following:

. Create a Hazelcast Cloud account
. Create a cluster on the Basic plan
. Add data to your cluster

== Step 1. Create a Hazelcast Cloud Account

. Go to link:{url-cloud-sign-up}[] and enter your details.
+
A confirmation will be sent to the provided email address. After confirming your email address, you'll be able to log into your account.

. Go to link:{url-cloud-sign-in}[] and log into your account, using one of the following options:
+
- The email address and password that you provided when you created the account
- Your GitHub account
- Your Google account

+
It may take up to 30 seconds to create the cluster. Until the cluster is ready, you will see a pending label and a spinning wheel.
+
NOTE: If you don't use your free cluster for 16 hours or more, it will be deleted along with any data that was stored in it.

Once your cluster is running and ready, you will see the Cluster Memory and Client Count charts as well as lifecycle information about the cluster.

Now, you have a running cluster, but it is empty. You can add data to the cluster, using a Hazelcast client application.

== Next Steps

Connect to your cluster, using one of the following clients:

- xref:java-client.adoc[Java]
- xref:net-client.adoc[.NET]
- xref:nodejs-client.adoc[Node.js] 
- xref:python-client.adoc[Python]
- xref:go-client.adoc[Go]
- xref:sql.adoc[SQL]
