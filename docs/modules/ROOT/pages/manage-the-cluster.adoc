= Stopping and Resuming Clusters
:description: Stopping a cluster saves your cluster's configuration and stops charges accumulating. All map entries, JCache entries, and jobs are persisted so you can stop and resume your cluster at any time without losing that data.

== Before you Begin

To stop clusters in a team, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Stopping a Cluster

Stopping your cluster can help minimize your costs during development because you are only charged for running clusters.

To stop a cluster, go to *Manage Cluster* and click *Stop*.

When you stop a cluster, Hazelcast Cloud saves your configuration so that you can resume the cluster at a later time.

== Resuming a Cluster

When you resume a cluster, Hazelcast restarts it with the same configuration as before it was stopped. Persisted data is also restored from disk. 

To resume a cluster after stopping it, go to *Manage Cluster* and click *Resume*.
