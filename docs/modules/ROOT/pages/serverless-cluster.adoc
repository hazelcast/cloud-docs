= Serverless Clusters
:description: Hazelcast Serverless is a fully managed, multi-tenant deployment of a Hazelcast cluster.
:toc-levels: 3

{description}

You pay only for the amount of data that you put in storage, without needing to know what that might be before you start. If you use more storage, Hazelcast will allocate more hardware to your cluster to handle the increased load. If you use less storage, then youâ€™ll pay less.

Consider a Serverless cluster for the following:

- Starter projects
- Development environments
- Unpredicable scaling requirements
- Budget constraints

Hazelcast Serverless clusters can be one of two types. Both types use TLS to communicate with clients.

- <<dev,Development>>
- <<prod,Production>>

[[dev]]
== Serverless Development Clusters

Development clusters include only a single member. Single-member clusters are faster because you don't need to wait for the cluster to replicate your cluster-side modules over other members or create and update backup replicas of your data.

Data is not backed up in development clusters. When the cluster restarts for any reason, you lose cluster data such as maps and cluster-side modules. You cannot currently convert a development cluster to a production cluster.

[[prod]]
== Serverless Production Clusters

Production clusters automatically scale up and down, depending on the amount of resources you use.

All cluster data is backed up automatically once per day so that you can stop and resume your clusters at any time. You can also trigger manual backups.
