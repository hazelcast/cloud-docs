= Serverless Clusters
:description: Hazelcast Serverless is a fully managed, multi-tenant deployment of Hazelcast. In Serverless clusters, you pay only for the amount of data that you put in storage, without needing to know what that might be before you start.

{description}

== When to Use Serverless

Consider a Serverless cluster for the following:

// tag::intended-apps[]
- Starter projects
- Unpredicable scaling requirements
- Strict budget constraints
// end::intended-apps[]

== Cluster Types

// tag::types[]
Hazelcast Serverless clusters can be one of two types: Development and Production.
// end::types[]

[[dev]]
== Development Clusters

// tag::development[]
Development clusters include only a single member for fast, iterative development while you prototype your application.
// end::development[]

=== Limitations

Development clusters have the following limitations:

- Maximum 1 GB of storage
- No ability to scale up
- Data is not backed up or persisted

When a development cluster restarts for any reason, you lose cluster data such as maps and cluster-side modules.

NOTE: You cannot currently convert a development cluster to a production cluster.

[[prod]]
== Production Clusters

// tag::production[]
Production clusters are for applications that have already been tested and are ready to be deployed in real-world scenarios.
// end::production[]

Production clusters automatically scale up and down, depending on the amount of resources you use.

All cluster data is backed up automatically once per day so that you can stop and resume your clusters at any time. You can also trigger manual backups.
