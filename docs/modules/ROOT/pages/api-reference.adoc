Hazelcast Cloud uses link:{url-graphql}[GraphQL] to provide a public API to consumers.

== Queries

=== Cloud Providers

While creating a Hazelcast Cluster on Hazelcast Cloud, you need to decide on which Cloud Provider you will use. You can make this decision according to where your current infrastructure is. Also, the cloud providers we support change according to the type of product you will use. We support different cloud providers on the Starter and Enterprise Hazelcast Cloud products. So, you need to check available cloud providers before creating a cluster from our GraphQL API with a `query cloudProviders` 

[source,shell]
----
query {
  cloudProviders {
    name
    isEnabledForStarter
    isEnabledForEnterprise
  }
}
----

=== Regions

Regions are geographic locations of where your cloud resources are located. Different cloud providers support different regions. Also, there may be some regions that we don't support yet. So that you need to check available regions before creating a Hazecast Cluster on Hazecast Cloud from our GraphQL API with `query regions`. 

[source,shell]
----
query {
  regions(cloudProvider: "aws") {
    name
    isEnabledForStarter
    isEnabledForEnterprise
  }
}
----

=== Hazelcast Versions

In order to create or upgrade a version of an Enterprise type of cluster on Hazelcast Cloud, you need to select which Hazelcast version you need. The Hazelcast versions the Hazelcast Cloud supports changes according to the type of the product. So that you need to check available Hazelcast versions for your need with `hazelcastVersion query`

[source,shell]
----
query {
  hazelcastVersions {
    version
    upgradeableVersions
  }
}
----

=== Instance Types

Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications. Instance types changes according to a cloud provider, regions, and the ones we supported. In order to create *Enterprise Cluster on Hazelcast Cloud*, you need to select which instance type you will use with   `query instanceTypes`.

[source,shell]
----
query {
  instanceTypes(cloudProvider: "aws") {
    name
    totalMemory
  }
}
----

=== Cluster Details

You can fetch the details of the cluster you selected with Id as an input. To get details of select cluster you need to use `cluster query`

[source,shell]
----
query {
  cluster(clusterId: "423") {
    id
    name
    password
    port
    hazelcastVersion
    isAutoScalingEnabled
    isHotBackupEnabled
    isHotRestartEnabled
    isIpWhitelistEnabled
    isTlsEnabled
    productType {
      name
      isFree
    }
    state
    createdAt
    startedAt
    stoppedAt
    discoveryTokens {source,token}
  }
}
----

=== Cluster List
You can list all of your clusters according to their type of product (`STARTER`, `ENTERPRISE`) with their details. You can fetch them will using `clusters query` with providing product type. 

[source,shell]
----
query {
  clusters(productType:"STARTER") {
    id
    name
    password
    port
    hazelcastVersion
    isAutoScalingEnabled
    isHotBackupEnabled
    isHotRestartEnabled
    isIpWhitelistEnabled
    isTlsEnabled
    productType {
      name
      isFree
    }
    state
    createdAt
    startedAt
    stoppedAt
    discoveryTokens {source,token}
  }
}
----

== Mutations

===Â Create Starter Cluster

You can create a new *Starter Hazelcast Cluster** with `createStarterCluster` mutation. This mutation needs at least the following inputs; `name, cloud provider, region, cluster type, total memory, and Hazelcast version`. You can optionally provide other properties like data structures etc.

[WARNING]
====
You need to collect some inputs from other queries.

In this case, you need to get `cloudProvider` from `cloudProviders query`,  `region` from `regions query`.

Also, you need to care about if the cloud provider and region are enabled for the starter version of the Hazelcast Cloud Product.
====

TIP: You can optionally provide other properties like data structures, hot backup features, etc.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  createStarterCluster(
    input: {
      name: "my-cluster"
      cloudProvider: "aws"
      region: "us-west-2"
      clusterType: SMALL
      totalMemory: 2
      hazelcastVersion: VERSION_4_0
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
----

=== Create Enterprise Cluster

You can create a new *Enterprise Hazelcast Cluster* with `createEnterpriseCluster mutation`. This mutation needs at least the following inputs; `name, cloud provider, region, instance type, instance per zone, Hazelcast version, public access value, and CIDR block`.


[WARNING]
====
You need to collect some inputs from other queries.

In this case, you need to get `cloudProvider` from `cloudProviders query`,  `region` from `regions query`, instanceType from `instanceTypes query`.

Also, you need to care about if the cloud provider and region are enabled for the enterprise version of the Hazelcast Cloud Product.
====

TIP: You can optionally provide other properties like, zone type, data structures, hot backup features, etc.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  createEnterpriseCluster(
    input:{
      name: "my-cluster"
      cloudProvider: "aws"
      region: "eu-west-2"
      zoneType: MULTI
      instanceType: "m5.large"
      instancePerZone: 2
      hazelcastVersion: "4.0"
      isPublicAccessEnabled: true
      cidrBlock: "10.0.1.0/16"
    }
  )
  {
    id
  }
}
----

=== Delete Cluster

You can delete your cluster with `deleteCluster` mutation with providing id of the cluster as an argument.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  deleteCluster(clusterId:"101") {
    clusterId
  }
}
----

=== Stop Cluster

You can stop your *Starter Hazelcast Cluster* with `stopCluster` mutation with providing id of the cluster as an argument.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  stopCluster(clusterId:"101") {
    clusterId
  }
}
----

=== Resume Cluster

You can resume your *Starter Hazelcast Cluster* with `resumeCluster` mutation with providing id of the cluster as an argument.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  resumeCluster(clusterId:"101") {
    clusterId
  }
}
