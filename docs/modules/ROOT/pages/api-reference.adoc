== Queries

=== Cloud Providers

While creating a cluster on {hazelcast-cloud}, you need to decide which cloud provider to use. You can make this decision according to where your current infrastructure is. Also, the cloud providers we support change according to the type of product you will use. We support different cloud providers on the Standard and Enterprise plans. So, you need to check available cloud providers before creating a cluster from our GraphQL API with a `query cloudProviders` 

[source,shell]
----
query {
  cloudProviders {
    name
    isEnabledForStandard
    isEnabledForEnterprise
  }
}
----

=== Regions

Regions are geographic locations of where your cloud resources are located. Different cloud providers support different regions. Also, there may be some regions that we don't support yet. So that you need to check available regions before creating a Hazecast Cluster on Hazecast Cloud from our GraphQL API with `query regions`. 

[source,shell]
----
query {
  regions(cloudProvider: "aws") {
    name
    isEnabledForStandard
    isEnabledForEnterprise
  }
}
----

=== Hazelcast Versions

In order to create or upgrade a version of an Enterprise type of cluster on {hazelcast-cloud}, you need to select which Hazelcast version you need. The Hazelcast versions the {hazelcast-cloud} supports changes according to the type of the product. So that you need to check available Hazelcast versions for your need with `hazelcastVersion query`

[source,shell]
----
query {
  hazelcastVersions {
    version
    upgradeableVersions
  }
}
----

=== Instance Types

Instance types comprise varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity and give you the flexibility to choose the appropriate mix of resources for your applications. Instance types changes according to a cloud provider, regions, and the ones we supported. In order to create *Enterprise Cluster on {hazelcast-cloud}*, you need to select which instance type you will use with   `query instanceTypes`.

[source,shell]
----
query {
  instanceTypes(cloudProvider: "aws") {
    name
    totalMemory
  }
}
----

=== Availability Zones

Availability zones are isolated locations within data center regions from which public cloud services originate and operate. In order to create *Enterprise Cluster on {hazelcast-cloud}*, you need to select which availability zones should be used. This availability zones changes according to the cloud provider and region. Also, the number of instances you need, may not be available on this availability zones. So that you need to check available availability zones for your demand with `availabilityZones query`.

[source,shell]
----
query {
  availabilityZones(
    cloudProvider: "aws"
    region: "us-west-2"
    instanceType: "m5.large"
    instanceCount: 5
  ) {
    name
  }
}
----

=== Cluster Details

You can fetch the details of the cluster you selected with Id as an input. To get details of select cluster you need to use `cluster query`

[source,shell]
----
query {
  cluster(clusterId: "423") {
    id
    name
    password
    port
    hazelcastVersion
    isAutoScalingEnabled
    isHotBackupEnabled
    isHotRestartEnabled
    isIpWhitelistEnabled
    isTlsEnabled
    productType {
      name
      isFree
    }
    state
    createdAt
    startedAt
    stoppedAt
    discoveryTokens {source,token}
  }
}
----

=== Cluster List

You can list all of your clusters according to their type of product (`STANDARD`, `ENTERPRISE`) with their details. You can fetch them will using `clusters query` with providing product type. 

[source,shell]
----
query {
  clusters(productType:"STANDARD") {
    id
    name
    password
    port
    hazelcastVersion
    isAutoScalingEnabled
    isHotBackupEnabled
    isHotRestartEnabled
    isIpWhitelistEnabled
    isTlsEnabled
    productType {
      name
      isFree
    }
    state
    createdAt
    startedAt
    stoppedAt
    discoveryTokens {source,token}
  }
}
----

== Mutations

=== Create Serverless Cluster

You can create a new *Serverless* cluster with the `createStandardCluster` mutation. This mutation needs at least the following inputs; `name, cloud provider, region, cluster type, total memory, and Hazelcast version`. You can optionally provide other properties like data structures etc.

[WARNING]
====
You need to collect some inputs from other queries.

In this case, you need to get `cloudProvider` from `cloudProviders query`,  `region` from `regions query`.
====

TIP: You can optionally provide other properties like data structures, hot backup features, etc.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  createStandardCluster(
    input: {
      name: "my-cluster"
      cloudProvider: "aws"
      region: "us-west-2"
      clusterType: SMALL
      totalMemory: 2
      hazelcastVersion: VERSION_4_0
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
----

=== Create Dedicated Cluster

You can create a new *Dedicated* cluster with the `createEnterpriseCluster mutation`. This mutation needs at least the following inputs; `name, cloud provider, region, zones, instance type, instance per zone, Hazelcast version, public access value, and CIDR block`.


[WARNING]
====
You need to collect some inputs from other queries.

In this case, you need to get `cloudProvider` from `cloudProviders query`,  `region` from `regions query`, `zones`  from `availabilityZones query`, instanceType from `instanceTypes query`.

Also, you need to care about if the cloud provider and region are enabled for Dedicated.
====

TIP: You can optionally provide other properties such as data structures and Persistence features.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  createEnterpriseCluster(
    input:{
        name: "my-cluster"
      cloudProvider: "aws"
      region: "eu-west-2"
      zones: ["eu-west-2a", "eu-west-2b"]
      instanceType: "m5.large"
      instancePerZone: 2
      hazelcastVersion: "4.0"
      isPublicAccessEnabled: true
      cidrBlock: "10.0.1.0/16"
    }
  )
  {
    id
  }
}
----

=== Delete Cluster

You can delete your cluster with `deleteCluster` mutation by providing the ID of the cluster as an argument.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  deleteCluster(clusterId:"101") {
    clusterId
  }
}
----

=== Stop Cluster

You can stop your *Standard Hazelcast Cluster* with `stopCluster` mutation by providing the ID of the cluster as an argument.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  stopCluster(clusterId:"101") {
    clusterId
  }
}
----

=== Resume Cluster

You can resume your *Standard Hazelcast Cluster* with `resumeCluster` mutation by providing the ID of the cluster as an argument.

[source,shell]
----
mutation {
  resumeCluster(clusterId:"101") {
    clusterId
  }
}
----
