= Connecting to a Hazelcast Cloud Cluster
:description: To communicate with a cluster in Hazelcast Cloud, you need a client. Hazelcast offers client libraries in a variety of languages as well as a command-line client. To use a client, you need to authenticate it with the correct credentials.

== Before you Begin

If your cluster is running in a private instance of Hazelcast Dedicated, you need to xref:vpc-peering.adoc[set up a peering connection to the cluster].

== Authenticating a Client

To authenticate a client, you must configure it with the following details. To find these details, click *Connect your Application* in the Hazelcast Cloud console.

|Configuration|Description

|Cluster name
|A unique name that is given to your cluster. This is not the name that you chose when you created the cluster.

|Discovery token
|A unique token that maps to the current IP address of the Hazelcast Cloud cluster. Cluster IP addresses may change. This token allows clients to find out the current IP address of the cluster and connect to it.

|Keystore file
|A file that contains the information that a client needs to authenticate over TLS.

|Keystore password
|The password that a client can use to access the keystore file.

You can configure these details, using either a client library API or a client configuration file.
