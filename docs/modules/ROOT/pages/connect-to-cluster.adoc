= Connecting to {hazelcast-cloud} Clusters
:description: To communicate with a cluster in {hazelcast-cloud}, you need a client. Hazelcast offers clients in a variety of languages as well as a command-line client for quick prototyping and scripting.
:page-aliases: connect-to-private-cluster.adoc

{description}

You can do the following to connect to the cluster:

- Download a <<download, preconfigured sample client>>.
- Use <<advanced, advanced setup>> to configure your own client.
- Use the <<sql,SQL browser>> in Management Center.

== Before you Begin

If you're using a Dedicated cluster, you need to authorize your network to allow clients to connect to your cluster. Dedicated clusters are private by default to prevent attacks such as denial of service. To authorize your network, you can do the following:

- Add client IP addresses to a xref:ip-white-list.adoc[whitelist].
- Set up xref:vpc-peering.adoc[PrivateLink or VPC peering].

TIP: You should use PrivateLink or VPC peering if your clients' IP addresses are not static or if you want to limit your cluster's exposure to the Internet.

== Using a Preconfigured Client

Your cluster comes with a downloadable client that's preconfigured to connect to your cluster.

. Sign into the [.console]*link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console]*.
. Click *Connect your Application*.
. Select a client from the dropdown.
. Follow the on-screen instructions.

For a complete tutorial, see xref:get-started.adoc[].

[[advanced]]
== Using Advanced Setup

Hazelcast offers a variety of link:https://hazelcast.com/clients/[clients] that you can download and configure yourself. After downloading a client, you'll need to configure it with your connection credentials.

The TLS credentials are necessary only if your cluster has TLS enabled. You can find out if your cluster has TLS enabled in the *Cluster Details* section of your dashboard.

[[sql]]
== Using the SQL Browser

In Management Center, you can open a SQL shell in your cluster and submit SQL queries directly from your web browser.

. Sign into the [.console]*link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console]* and select your cluster.

. Click *Management Center*.

. In the top toolbar, click *SQL Browser*.

. Enter your SQL queries.
