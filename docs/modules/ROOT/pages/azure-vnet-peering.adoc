Since security is vital in Dedicated, your clusters are installed within a private virtual network and can not be accessed unless you choose *Public Access* on cluster creation. So to connect private Azure Hazelcast Clusters, you need to establish a vNet peering connection between your network and Hazelcast Cluster network. 

== Before you Begin

Download the {hazelcast-cloud} CLI from link:{url-github-cloud-cli[Github].

link:{url-azure-cli}[Download the Azure CLI] and make sure you have the link:{url-azure-permissions}[correct permissions].

To create a peering connection on a team cluster, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Creating a Peering Connection

. Create the peering connection.
+
[source,shell]
----
hzcloud azure-peering create \
--cluster-id={YOUR_CLUSTER_ID} \
--tenant-id={YOUR_TENANT_ID} \
--subscription-id={YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID} \
--resource-group={YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP} \
--vnet={YOUR_VNET_NAME}
----
+
Make sure to replace the following placeholders:
+
- `YOUR_CLUSTER_ID` with the ID of your cluster.
+
To get your cluster ID, use the `hzcloud enterprise-cluster list` command of the {hazelcast-cloud} CLI.
- `YOUR_TENANT_ID` with the ID of your tenant which contains your subscription.
+
To get your tenant ID, use the `az account list` command of the Azure CLI.
- `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with the ID of your subscription which contains your resource group.
+
To get your subscription ID, use the `az account list` command of the Azure CLI.
- `YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP` with the Name of your resource group which contains your vNet.
+
To get your resource group name, use the `az network vnet list` command of the Azure CLI.
- `YOUR_VNET_NAME` with the name of your Virtual Network that you will make vNet peering.
+
To get your vnet name, use the `az network vnet list` command of the Azure CLI.
+
This command will create a service principal on your account and assign the `Network Contributor` role to it. Then, it will create peering for both sides. This command may take up to 5 minutes to finish.
+
WARNING: The CIDR of your Dedicated cluster and the CIDR of your VPC should not be overlapped otherwise, it will fail.

. Check for active peerings from the *Peerings* tab after you select your Virtual Network on Azure for your side of peering. You can filter by its peer, which will be `cl-<CLUSTER_ID>`. On the example below, it is `cl53949` because the cluster ID was `53949`

== Listing Peering Connections

You can list Azure vNet peerings from the {hazelcast-cloud} console by going to *Settings* > *vNet*.
You can check where the connection established by checking the name of the vNet with it's CIDR from this list.

Also, you can use Go SDK, {hazelcast-cloud} CLI for listing vNet peerings as shown below.

== Deleting Peering Connections

You can delete Azure vNet peerings of your Hazelcast cluster on Azure from the vNet Peerings list by easily clicking the garbage can on the item.
