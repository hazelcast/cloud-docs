Since security is vital in Hazelcast Dedicated, your clusters are installed within a private virtual network and can not be accessed unless you choose *Public Access* on cluster creation. So to connect private Azure Hazelcast Clusters, you need to establish a vNet peering connection between your network and Hazelcast Cluster network. 

== Before you Begin

Download the Hazelcast Cloud CLI from link:{url-github-cloud-cli[Github].

link:{url-azure-cli}[Download the Azure CLI] and make sure you have the link:{url-azure-permissions}[correct permissions].

To create a peering connection on a team cluster, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Creating a Peering Connection

. Create the peering connection.
+
[source,shell]
----
hzcloud azure-peering create \
--cluster-id={YOUR_CLUSTER_ID} \
--tenant-id={YOUR_TENANT_ID} \
--subscription-id={YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID} \
--resource-group={YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP} \
--vnet={YOUR_VNET_NAME}
----
+
Make sure to replace the following placeholders:
+
- `YOUR_CLUSTER_ID` with the ID of your cluster.
+
To get your cluster ID, use the `hzcloud enterprise-cluster list` command of the Hazelcast Cloud CLI.
- `YOUR_TENANT_ID` with the ID of your tenant which contains your subscription.
+
To get your tenant ID, use the `az account list` command of the Azure CLI.
- `YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with the ID of your subscription which contains your resource group.
+
To get your subscription ID, use the `az account list` command of the Azure CLI.
- `YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP` with the Name of your resource group which contains your vNet.
+
To get your resource group name, use the `az network vnet list` command of the Azure CLI.
- `YOUR_VNET_NAME` with the name of your Virtual Network that you will make vNet peering.
+
To get your vnet name, use the `az network vnet list` command of the Azure CLI.
+
This command will create a service principal on your account and assign the `Network Contributor` role to it. Then, it will create peering for both sides (Hazelcast's, Your's). This command may take up to 5 minutes to finish.

WARNING: The CIDR of your Hazelcast Dedicated Cluster and the CIDR of your VPC should not be overlapped otherwise, it will fail.

. Check for active peerings from the Peerings tab after you select your Virtual Network on Azure for your side of peering. You can filter by its peer, which will be `cl-<CLUSTER_ID>`. On the example below, it is `cl53949` because the cluster ID was `53949`

== Listing Peering Connections

You can list Azure vNet peerings on your Enterprise Hazelcast Cluster on Azure from Console by going *Settings* > *vNet* Peering one by one as shown below.
You can check where the connection established by checking the name of the vNet with it's CIDR from this list.

Also, you can easily use Hazelcast Cloud SDK, Hazelcast Cloud CLI for listing vNet peerings as shown below.

== Deleting Peering Connections

You can delete Azure vNet peerings of your Hazelcast cluster on Azure from the vNet Peerings list by easily clicking the garbage can on the item.

client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
result, _, _ := client.AzurePeering.Delete(context.Background(), &models.DeleteAzurePeeringInput{
  Id: "ID_OF_PEERING",

fmt.Println(result.Status)
