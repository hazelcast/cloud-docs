= Send Logs of Dedicated Clusters to Amazon OpenSearch
:description: Set up a remote logging solution using Amazon OpenSearch Service. In this tutorial, you'll set up an Amazon OpenSearch domain and configure your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster to automatically send log files to it. You'll also learn how to view these logs in Kibana.

link:{url-amazon-opensearch}[Amazon OpenSearch Service] is based on link:{url-github-elasticsearch}[Elasticsearch], and allows you to search, analyze and visualize your cluster logs using Kibana.

[[set-up-opensearch-domain]]
== Step 1. Set Up an Amazon OpenSearch Domain

Create an Amazon OpenSearch domain to receive log files from your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

. link:{url-aws-signup}[Create an AWS account] if you don't have one already.
. For testing purposes, you can sign in as root user, but we recommend that you sign in with an link:{url-aws-iam-user}[IAM account] for Production use.
+
TIP: Amazon provides a link:{url-aws-managed-policy}[managed policy] for its OpenSearch service. 
. From the list of regions on the top menu, select the region that's closest to your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.
. Search for and select *Amazon OpenSearch Service*. The Dashboard opens ready for you to start configuration.
+

. Click *Create domain*.

[[configure-opensearch-domain]]
== Step 2. Configure Your OpenSearch Domain

To get a logging solution up and running, update the following domain settings. You can go back and adjust them later to suit your needs.

. In the *Domain name* field, enter a short name for your OpenSearch domain. For example, _hazelcast-cloud-logs_.
. In the *Deployment type* section:
** For testing purposes, select *Development and testing* as the deployment type.
** From the *Version* list, select *Elasticsearch* > *7.10*.
** Select *Include older versions*.
. In the *Data nodes* section, under *Availability Zones*, select *1-AZ*.
. In the *Network* section, select *Public access* to use fine-grained access control to secure the OpenSearch domain and data. VPC Peering connections between {hazelcast-cloud} clusters and OpenSearch instances are not currently supported.

. In the *Fine-grained access control* section, select *Create Master User* and enter a username and password for the account.
+
TIP: Make a note of the master user credentials. You'll need them later to access Kibana, and to make any configuration changes to your OpenSearch domain.

. In the *Access policy* section, select *Only use fine-grained access control*.
. Click *Create* to build your domain. You'll need to wait until your OpenSearch environment and the following URLs are created. You need both URLs to complete your logging setup.

** *Kibana URL*
** *Domain endpoint*

[[configure-cloud-logging]]
== Step 3. Configure Logging Integration in {hazelcast-cloud}

Configure your Dedicated cluster to send log files to the OpenSearch domain.

You'll need the master user credentials and domain endpoint that you created when you <<configure-opensearch-domain, configured OpenSearch>>.

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[{hazelcast-cloud} console] and select the cluster that want to integrate with OpenSearch.
. Select *Manage Cluster* > *Settings* > *Logging*.
. From the *Logging Technology* list, select *Elastic Stack (ELK)*.
. In the *Username* and *Password* fields, enter your master user credentials.
. In the *URL* field, enter the domain endpoint for your OpenSearch domain followed by port number 443. 
+ 
For example: `https://search-<domain-name>-lxxxxxxx3f2v3wz3tlkh4.us-west-1.es.amazonaws.com:443`
+
OpenSearch supports HTTPS over port 443.

. Click *Create Integration*. Within 30 seconds, Hazelcast starts to send log files to OpenSearch, which are made available in Kibana.

== Step 4. Set Up a Kibana Dashboard

Create an index pattern to load the logs received from OpenSearch into a Kibana dashboard. 

You'll need the master user credentials and Kibana URL that you created when you <<configure-opensearch-domain, configured OpenSearch>>.

[NOTE]
====
To create log data for viewing, check for the following:

* Your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster is running.
* A client is writing data to the cluster.
====

. From your domain details page in OpenSearch, click the Kibana URL.
. Log in to Kibana, using your master user credentials.
. Select *Explore on my own* to skip onboarding.
. From the *Select tenant* dialog box, select *Private* and click *Confirm*.
. From the main menu, select *Kibana* > *Discover* to start your set up.
. Click *Create index pattern*. An index pattern tells Kibana which indices contain the data that you want to view.
. In the *Index pattern* field, enter a wildcard `*` to find all log data received from OpenSearch. 
. When Kibana finds the {hazelcast-cloud} logs, click *Next step*.
. From the *Time field* list, select *updated_at* so that you'll be able to filter your log file data by time.
. Click *Create index pattern*. Your log file data is ready to view. Simply select *Kibana* > *Discover* from the main menu.

If necessary, you can now return to your OpenServe domain and increase the number of nodes or availability zones to add resilience to the logging service.

== Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to do the following:

* Create an Amazon OpenSearch domain to receive log files from your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.
* Configure your Dedicated cluster to automatically send log files to the OpenSearch domain.
* Load log files into a Kibana dashboard using an index pattern.
