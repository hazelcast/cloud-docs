== Context

Streaming data is data that is continuously generated in small sizes. Streaming data includes a wide variety of sources such as retail purchases, financial trades, or telemetry from connected vehicles. This data isn't usually useful by itself because of its size. It must be enriched with contextual data that is often stored in a database.

Hazelcast allows you to connect to streaming data sources such as Confluent Cloud Kafka clusters as well as cache contextual data in your Hazelcast cluster. With access to both of these data sources, you can process your data in one place and store the results in a materialized view. 

Materialized views are useful for speeding up queries that are repeated. Instead of performing resource-intensive queries against large datasets in different sources, your applications can query a materialized view and retrieve a precomputed result.

== Before you Begin

You need the following:

- A Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} cluster. This tutorial assumes that you have a production cluster for xref:cloud:ROOT:create-serverless-cluster.adoc[{hazelcast-cloud} Serverless].

- A basic understanding of link:https://hazelcast.com/glossary/kafka/[Kafka].

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Set Up the Hazelcast CLI

You need to use the Hazelcast CLI in later steps to open connections to the SQL shell of your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster.

. Install the Hazelcast CLI client for your operating system. Although the Hazelcast CLI client is included in Hazelcast Enterprise, you don't need a license to run it.

At the moment, Hazelcast does not support any Windows package managers. You can link:https://hazelcast.com/get-started/download/[download the latest version as a ZIP file instead and extract the files to your local machine].
--
====

. From a command prompt, change into the root directory where Hazelcast Enterprise is installed.

. Execute one of the following commands to check that the Hazelcast CLI client is installed.

.. For Linux and Mac OS:
+
[source,shell]
----
bin/hz-cli -V
----
.. For Windows:
+
[source,command]
----
bin\hz-cli -V
----

Next, you need to add the credentials that allow the Hazelcast CLI to connect to your cluster.

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console, window=blank].

. Select the production cluster that you want to use for this tutorial.

. In *Cluster Details*, click *Connect Client*.

. In the *Quick Connection Guide*, click the SQL icon and then click *Download*.

. Extract the ZIP file and copy all the files into the root directory where Hazelcast Enterprise is installed.

. From a command prompt, still in the root directory, execute one of the following commands to connect to your cluster.

.. For Linux and Mac OS:
+
[source,shell]
```bash
bin/hz-cli -f hazelcast-client-with-ssl.yml sql
```
.. For Windows:
+
[source,command]
```bash
bin\hz-cli -f hazelcast-client-with-ssl.yml sql
```
A SQL prompt is displayed:
+
```

```
+
The Hazelcast CLI client is successfully connected to your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster ready for later steps in this tutorial.

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Create a Free Confluent Cloud Kafka Cluster

. link:https://confluent.cloud/signup[Create a Confluent Cloud account] if you don't have one already.

. Create a Basic cluster.

. Select the same cloud provider as your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster and the region that's closest to your Hazelcast cluster. For example, AWS Oregon (us-west-2).

. Skip payment and launch the cluster.

. Click your cluster's name in the breadcrumbs at the top of the page.
+
image:confluent-cloud-breadcrumbs.png[Breadcrumbs that display the cluster name]

. Click *Topics* > *Create Topic* and enter *trades* in the *Topic name* field. 

. Click *Create with defaults*. Confluent Cloud won't create a topic if you try to insert data into a topic that doesn't exist.

. Click *Clients* and select *Java*. Hazelcast uses a Java client to connect to Kafka clusters, so you need the configuration for a Java client.

. Click *Create Kafka cluster API key* and enter the name of your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster in the description. This name helps you remember that your cluster is using that API key the next time you view them in Confluent Cloud.

. Click *Download and continue*. The configuration snippet now includes your API key and secret.

. Copy the code in your configuration snippet from the top to `session.timeout.ms=45000`. You won't use the Schema Registry in this tutorial.

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Create a Mapping to the Confluent Cloud Cluster

To allow Hazelcast to access the `trades` topic that you created in your Confluent Cloud Kafka cluster, you need to create a mapping to it.

. Sign into the link:{page-cloud-console}[Hazelcast {hazelcast-cloud} console,window=_blank] and select your cluster.

. Go to *SQL* in the left navigation to open the SQL browser.

. Create the mapping. Paste the connection configurations that you copied from Confluent Cloud below the `valueFormat` option. Make sure to format the configuration as necessary. For example:
+
[source,sql]
----
-- Create a mapping to a Kafka topic called 'trades'.
CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING trades (
  id BIGINT,
  ticker VARCHAR,
  price_usd DECIMAL,
  amount BIGINT)
TYPE Kafka
OPTIONS (
  -- Serialization format
  'valueFormat' = 'json-flat',
  -- Required connection configs for Kafka producer, consumer, and admin
  'bootstrap.servers'='<YOUR BOOTSTRAP SERVER>',
  'security.protocol'='SASL_SSL',
  'sasl.jaas.config'='org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule 
  required username="<YOUR API KEY>" 
  password="<YOUR API SECRET>";',
  'sasl.mechanism'='PLAIN',
  --Required for correctness in Apache Kafka clients prior to 2.6
  'client.dns.lookup'='use_all_dns_ips',
  -- Best practice for higher availability in Apache Kafka clients prior to 3.0
  'session.timeout.ms'='45000'
);
----
+
The `trades` topic accepts trades in JSON format, using the following schema:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": ,
  "ticker": ,
  "price_usd": ,
  "amount": ,
}
----

. Publish some new trades to the topic.
+
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO trades VALUES
  (1, 'SORG', 5.5, 10),
  (2, 'EORG', 14, 20);
----

. If you haven't started the SQL prompt on your {hazelcast-cloud} cluster, do it now:
+
```bash
hz-cli -f hazelcast-client-with-ssl.yml sql
```

. In the SQL prompt, write a streaming query that filters trade messages, where the total trade order is more than $100.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT ticker, price_usd, amount
  FROM trades
  WHERE price_usd * amount > 100;
----
+
.Result
[%collapsible]
====
The result is an empty table. You don't see any results because, by default, Confluent Cloud consumers read messages, starting from the latest offset. The trades that you published already happened, and so they are not included.

```
+------------+----------------------+-------------------+
|ticker      |           price_usd  |          amount   |
+------------+----------------------+-------------------+
```
====

. Stop the streaming query by pressing kbd:[Ctrl + C] to close the connection to the SQL prompt.

. Back in the SQL browser, create the mapping to the topic again, but this time add the `'auto.offset.reset'='earliest'` configuration. This configuration tells the Kafka consumer to read all data in the topic from the beginning, not just from the latest offset.
+
[source,sql]
----
-- Create a mapping to a Kafka topic called 'trades'.
CREATE OR REPLACE MAPPING trades (
  id BIGINT,
  ticker VARCHAR,
  price_usd DECIMAL,
  amount BIGINT)
TYPE Kafka
OPTIONS (
  -- Serialization format
  'valueFormat' = 'json-flat',
  -- Required connection configs for Kafka producer, consumer, and admin
  'bootstrap.servers'='<YOUR BOOTSTRAP SERVER>',
  'security.protocol'='SASL_SSL',
  'sasl.jaas.config'='org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule 
  required username="<YOUR API KEY>" 
  password="<YOUR API SECRET>";',
  'sasl.mechanism'='PLAIN',
  --Required for correctness in Apache Kafka clients prior to 2.6
  'client.dns.lookup'='use_all_dns_ips',
  -- Best practice for higher availability in Apache Kafka clients prior to 3.0
  'session.timeout.ms'='45000',
  'auto.offset.reset'='earliest'
);
----
+
TIP: You can find your previous mapping query in the *History* tab of the SQL browser.

. In the SQL prompt, enter the same streaming query that gave no results the last time you ran it.
+
[source,sql]
----
SELECT ticker, price_usd, amount
  FROM trades
  WHERE price_usd * amount > 100;
----
+
.Result
[%collapsible]
====
Hazelcast executes the query and filters the results, using your previous trades:

```
+-----------------+----------------------+-------------------+
|ticker           |       price_usd      |       amount      |
+-----------------+----------------------+-------------------+
|EORG             |                  14  |               20  |
```
====

. Stop the streaming query by pressing kbd:[Ctrl + C] to close the connection to the SQL prompt.

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Enrich the Data in the Kafka Messages

To reduce network latency, Kafka messages are often small and contain minimal data. For example, the `trades` topic does not contain any information about the company that's associated with a given ticker. To get deeper insights from data in Kafka topics, you can join query results with contextual data.

. Open the SQL browser.

. Create a mapping to a new map called `companies` in Hazelcast. The new map is for storing the company information that you'll use to enrich results from the `trades` topic.
+
```sql
CREATE MAPPING companies (
__key BIGINT,
ticker VARCHAR,
company VARCHAR,
marketcap BIGINT)
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
'keyFormat'='bigint',
'valueFormat'='json-flat');
```

. Add some entries to the `companies` map.
+
```sql
INSERT INTO companies VALUES
(1, 'SORG', 'Example Startup Organization', 100000),
(2, 'EORG', 'Example Enterprise Organization', 5000000);
```

. Merge results from the `companies` map and `trades` topic so you can see the company name that's associated with each ticker.
+
```sql
SELECT trades.ticker, companies.company, trades.amount
FROM trades
JOIN companies
ON companies.ticker = trades.ticker;
```
+
.Result
[%collapsible]
====
Hazelcast is executing the streaming query.

```
+------------+-------------------------------+--------------+
|ticker      |company                        |amount        |
+------------+-----------+-------------------+--------------|
|SORG        |Example Startup Organization   |10            |
|EORG        |Example Enterprise Organization|20            |
```
====

. Click *Stop Query*.


== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Create a Materialized View

You can set up an automated job to continuously run the streaming query and cache the results in a Hazelcast map.

. Open the SQL browser.

. Create a mapping to a new map called `trade_map`. This map is your materialized view, which caches the enriched results of the streaming query.
+
```sql
CREATE MAPPING trade_map (
__key BIGINT,
ticker VARCHAR,
company VARCHAR,
amount BIGINT)
TYPE IMap
OPTIONS (
'keyFormat'='bigint',
'valueFormat'='json-flat');
```

. Submit a job to your cluster that will monitor your `trade` topic for changes and store them in a map. The processing guarantee tells Hazelcast to save the current offsets so that the cluster can resume the job even if the cluster restarts.
+
```sql
CREATE JOB ingest_trades
OPTIONS (
  'processingGuarantee' = 'exactlyOnce'
) AS
SINK INTO trade_map
SELECT trades.id, trades.ticker, companies.company, trades.amount
FROM trades
JOIN companies
ON companies.ticker = trades.ticker;
```
+
A job will run indefinitely until it is explicitly canceled or the cluster is shut down. Even if you exit the command prompt, the job will continue running on the cluster.

. List your job to make sure that it was successfully submitted.
+
```sql
SHOW JOBS;
```
+
.Result
[%collapsible]
====
A job called `ingest_trades` is running.

```
+--------------------+
|name                |
+--------------------+
|ingest_trades       |
+--------------------+
```
====

. Query your materialized view to see that results have been added to it.
+
```sql
SELECT * FROM trade_map;
```
+
.Result
[%collapsible]
====
The query results are being stored in your map.

```
+---------+---------+---------------------------------+------------+
|       id|ticker   |   company                       |      amount|
+---------+---------+---------------------------------+------------+
|        2|EORG     |Example Enterprise Organization  |          20|
|        1|SORG     |Example Startup Organization     |          10|
+---------+---------+----------+----------------------+------------+
```
====

. Publish some more trades to the topic.
+
[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO trades VALUES
  (3, 'SORG', 5.7, 23),
  (4, 'EORG', 12, 54);
----
+
Your materialized view will continue to be updated for each new trade that's added to the topic in the Kafka cluster.

. Query your materialized view to see that results have been added to it.
+
```sql
SELECT * FROM trade_map;
```

== Step {counter:cnt-step}. Clean Up

Your running job is consuming resources in your cluster. When you don't need a job anymore, it's important to cancel it.

. To cancel your job, use the `DROP` statement to cancel it.
+
```sql
DROP JOB ingest_trades;
```

. Check that the job is no longer running.
+
```sql
SHOW JOBS;
```

The table is empty, which means your job is no longer running.
